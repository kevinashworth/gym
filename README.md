# GYM

## Notes to self

### Do not use

Tamagui
easy-peasy
Local state as a copy of server state

### Do use

Typescript, zod
zustand for local state
TanStack Query for server state
TanStack Query with ky, and sometimes just ky, for network requests

### Not built yet

Categories screen

Location screen:

- Add campaign functionality to Location screen ("Earn Rewards...")
- Modal to show a single image in large view
- Use a location's `is_favorite` 1) instead of `favorites` or 2) to improve favorites performance

For UX, add a message when the user has reached the end of the Search list. Also, for dev, why does pageInfo not show up below the search results all the time?

### Not planning to build
